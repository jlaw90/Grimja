3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 
Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 
license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 
a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 

4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 
modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 
of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
from this License); and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 
which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 
Participant. 

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a 
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software 
(as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms 
are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 
48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 
Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 
agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are 
responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws 
and regulation of any other countries) when You use, 
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer 
and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 
of liability.

available under a separate agreement available
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open
source developers, and thanks the community for its
important contributions and open standards-based technology,
which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with
notices and open source licenses from such communities and
third parties that govern the use of those portions, and any
licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and
obligations you may have under such open source licenses,
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all
Software in this distribution.

7. Term and Termination. 

The license and service term are set forth in your
Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will
terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
materially breach it or take any action in derogation of
Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may
terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in
Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a
claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to
Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination
of the Agreement.

8. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the
date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt,
the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be
free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal
use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".
Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this
limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software
media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do
not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the
above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you
specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from
state to state.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE
LEGALLY INVALID. 

10. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN
OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR
DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY
OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for
Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations
will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of
incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms
above may not be applicable to you. 

11. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other
materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S.
export control laws and may be subject to export or import
regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly
with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you
have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export,
re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to
you. 

12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.
Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or
subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights
in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as
set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of
Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212
(for non-DOD acquisitions). 

13. Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by
California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice
of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. 

14. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the
provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

15. Integration. 

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your
